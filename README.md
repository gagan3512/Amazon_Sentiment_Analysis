Amazon Sentiment Analysis Pipeline


Step 1: Dataset Loading and Exploration
Import Libraries: Begin by importing the necessary libraries such as pandas, TensorFlow, NLTK, and others.
Load Dataset: Load the Amazon reviews dataset from the specified path.
Data Exploration: Explore the dataset by checking its structure, summary statistics, and the distribution of sentiment scores.


Step 2: Data Preprocessing
Drop Irrelevant Columns: Remove unnecessary columns like 'Id', 'ProductId', 'UserId', etc.
Handle Missing Values: Check for missing values and decide whether to drop or impute them.
Text Preprocessing: Lowercase the text, remove HTML tags, punctuation, and stopwords. Tokenize the text and perform stemming or lemmatization if required.
Convert Sentiment Scores: Map sentiment scores to three classes: Negative, Neutral, and Positive based on score ranges.


Step 3: Visualization and Analysis
Sentiment Distribution: Visualize the distribution of sentiment classes in the dataset using bar plots or pie charts.
Text Length Analysis: Analyze the distribution of text lengths for positive and negative sentiment comments using histograms.
Word Clouds: Generate word clouds to visualize the most common words in positive, negative, and neutral sentiment comments.


Step 4: Feature Engineering
Encode Labels: Encode the sentiment classes into numerical values using LabelEncoder or one-hot encoding.
Split Dataset: Split the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
Vectorization: Vectorize the text data using techniques like CountVectorizer or TF-IDF.


Step 5: Model Building
Define Model Architecture: Choose a suitable deep learning architecture such as LSTM or CNN for sentiment analysis.
Tokenization and Padding: Tokenize the text data and pad sequences to ensure uniform length.
Create Embedding Layer: Add an embedding layer to the model to handle word embeddings.
Compile Model: Compile the model with appropriate loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics.


Step 6: Model Training
Train Model: Train the model using the training data while validating it on the validation set.
Monitor Performance: Monitor training progress by tracking metrics like accuracy, loss, precision, recall, and F1 score.


Step 7: Model Evaluation
Evaluate on Test Set: Evaluate the trained model on the test set to assess its performance.
Confusion Matrix: Visualize the confusion matrix to analyze the model's predictions across different sentiment classes.
Save Model: Save the trained model for future use or deployment.


Step 8: Hyperparameter Tuning
Optimize Hyperparameters: Fine-tune hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and model architecture to improve performance.
Cross-Validation: Use techniques like cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalization of the model.


Step 9: Model Deployment
Deploy Model: Deploy the trained model in a production environment for real-time sentiment analysis tasks.
Integration: Integrate the model into applications, websites, or APIs to make predictions on new data.


Step 10: Continuous Monitoring and Improvement
Continuously monitor the model's performance in production to detect any drift or degradation.
